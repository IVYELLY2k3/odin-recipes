    <p><strong><em>“Broasted” is a trademarked word. The cooking process of broasted chicken begins in the same way as fried chicken, where it gets seasoned and then rolled in batter and flour. However, from here begins the difference. Broasted chicken is first deep-fried in a high-pressure cooker for a minute to keep the breading intact. Thereafter, the lid of the cooker is closed to lock the moisture inside the chicken. Since the outside surface of the chicken is sealed, less penetration of oil in the chicken’s meat takes place. In simple words, broasted chicken is a chicken that is fried in oil but inside a pressure cooker, precisely a pressure fryer. </em></strong></p>
