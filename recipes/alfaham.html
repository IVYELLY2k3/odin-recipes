    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Chicken Marinatiom</li>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Chicken:</strong> I am using chicken leg quarters since they are more moist and tender than chicken breast.</li>
            <li><strong>Yogurt:</strong> I am using plain yogurt which will help keep the chicken moist during grilling in the oven to prevent from becoming dry.</li>
            <li><strong>Lemon:</strong> The acidity from the lemon juice, along with the yogurt, will help make the chicken more tender, and add tangy flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Ginger & Garlic:</strong> During the marination process, these two herbs will add aromatic and savory flavor to the chicken.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt & Black Pepper:</strong> Of course, like any meat, we need to season this Arabic grilled chicken with salt and black pepper.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>For the spices and herbs</li>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cumin Seeds</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Coriander Powder</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Cloves</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Cinnamon Stick</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Fenugreek seeds</strong></li>
            <li><strong></strong>Cardamom pods</li>
            <li><strong>Cloves</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Herbs:</strong> In addition to the spices, I am also using coriander leaves, red onion, ginger and garlic to further enhance the flavor and aroma of my chicken</li>
            <li><strong>Tomatoes: </strong>The tomatoes will add mild sweetness, tanginess, reddish color and moisture to my marination</li>
            <li><strong>Vegetable Oil:</strong> This will help bind the flavor of the marinade, and coat the chicken evenly.</li>
            <li><strong>Lemon Juice:</strong> This will add acidity flavor to the marinade.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
    <p><strong><em>Before grilling the chicken, it is important to marinate it first to help absorb the flavor and tenderize the meat.

Firstly, I made a shallow cut or "scoring" on the surface of the chicken. With this technique, my marinating sauce will penetrate deeper into the meat, enhancing the flavor and aroma.Next, I combined the chicken with plain yogurt, minced garlic & ginger, salt, and black pepper in a large bowl. Once you mix it gently, let it marinate for 30 minutes to 1 hour, and set it aside.</em></strong></p>
    <h2>Cooking Instruction</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>I toasted the spices in the pan for few minutes until it releases smoky aroma. After that, I transferred into the grinder to make into a powder. Set it aside.</li>
        <li>To make a marinade, I added the tomatoes, red onion, minced garlic & garlic, coriander leaves, lemon juice, and vegetable oil in a large food processor.</li>
        <li>Next, I transferred the ground spices into the food processor. Switch on the power and wait till it turns into a marinade sauce.</li>
        <li>After that, I combined and gently mixed the marinade sauce with my marinated yogurt chicken.</li>
        <li>To oven grill the chicken, transfer the marinated chicken to the baking tray.</li>
        <li>Firstly, I preheat the oven to 200 C or 400 F for a few minutes, before placing it in the oven. I baked it for 20 minutes first, and once it released its juice, used it to baste on the chicken, and then continued baking for 15 more minutes.</li>
        <li>After that, I placed it in the upper rack of the oven. I basted it again and broiled it for 5-10 minutes to achieve a charred texture. Once done, I transferred to the plate.</li>
        <li>To release a smoky flavor, I ignite charcoal directly over an open flame, then place it in the center of the same plate as the chicken. Adding hot oil to the charcoal releases smoke, which is then evenly distributed by covering the plate with a lid. This method imparts a smoky flavor to the chicken without requiring a charcoal grill.</li>
